Elgg-Hammer is a php script that runs when your Elgg pages start loading and it searches as requests arrive, Elgg-Hammer checks how 
long it's been since that client's last  request.

If a reasonable amount of time has passed, the page is served as usual. But if not, their "Hammer Count" is increased.

Oh oh ho ho ho! When the elgg hammer trigger levels count reaches, the user if is hammering is immediately suspended, and redirected
 to a page with a message  "must wait X amount of seconds before you will try again!" The more they continue to mess around with your
 website, the longer they will have to wait.
